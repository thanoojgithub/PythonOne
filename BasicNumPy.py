#Locality of Reference
#In computer science, locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality
#There are two basic types of reference locality â€“ temporal and spatial locality. 
#Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data, and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration. 
#Spatial locality (also termed data locality[3]) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as, traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array.
